# Skish
Sai Kiran Shell, a rudimentary shell that kinda works.

It can execute a couple of basic shell commands, and run any other program on the filesystem.
it has support for pipes and IO redirection.

The programs are searched under the directories listed in the $HOME/paths.txt file.
If this file doesn't exist, it will be created for you.

support for more features coming up soon.
